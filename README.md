# Gemma Model LoRA Tuning Guide

This repository contains documentation and examples for fine-tuning Google's Gemma language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

## Overview

LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that allows you to adapt large language models to specific tasks while using significantly less computational resources compared to full fine-tuning. This guide focuses on applying LoRA to Gemma models.

## Contents

- [LoRA Tuning Documentation](site/en/gemma/docs/lora_tuning.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook with detailed instructions and examples for LoRA fine-tuning of Gemma models

## Getting Started

To get started with LoRA tuning of Gemma models:

1. Review the [LoRA tuning notebook](site/en/gemma/docs/lora_tuning.ipynb) for step-by-step instructions
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed
3. Prepare your training data
4. Follow the examples to fine-tune the model for your specific use case
